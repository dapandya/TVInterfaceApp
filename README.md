# TV_Interface_App

HTML Javascript based TV interface app.
It supports basic navigation of a TV interface.

#Note: No js library has been used to create this app.

Currently only 4 keyboard keys are supported:
- UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT

With this app I am trying to demonstrate use of various JS patterns to build a scalable UI:
- Mediator
- CommonJS
- Promise
- Singleton
